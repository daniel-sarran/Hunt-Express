# Hunt-Express

`Hunt-Express` is a web application to organize the job search: log new positions applied to, recall dates, track progress per application, from "application submitted" to "offer" or "rejection" in a straightforward tabular format.

I knew I wanted to organize my personal internship hunt and decided to build a tool to help me with that, and got the added benefit of getting exposure to web development beyond coursework.

This project is driven by a NodeJS backend using Express to route and perform CRUD operations on MongoDB Atlas. 
The frontend is a straightforward single-page display of tabular data. 
It is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a custom-built Docker image on Cloud Run. 



###### Developer Update - 7/25/2021

`Hunt-Express` is live on the cloud! After some minor polish we have a minimum viable product that is up and running.
