# Hunt-Express

`Hunt-Express` is a web application to organize your job search: log details, track progress, advance, and decline job applications.
It is driven by a NodeJS backend using Express to route and perform CRUD operations on MongoDB Atlas. The frontend is a straightforward one-page display of tabular data. It is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a custom-built Docker image on Cloud Run. 

###### Developer Update - 7/25/2021

`Hunt-Express` is live on the cloud! After some minor polish we have a minimum viable product that is up and running.
